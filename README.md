# Hello world on Solana

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript
API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to
interact with programs on the Solana blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain hello world program
* A client that can send a "hello" to an account and get back the number of
  times "hello" has been sent

## Quick Start

[![Open in
Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld)

If you decide to open in Gitpod then refer to
[README-gitpod.md](README-gitpod.md), otherwise continue reading.

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example, depending
on your OS, they may already be installed:

- Install node (v14 recommended)
- Install npm
- Install the latest Rust stable from https://rustup.rs/
- Install Solana v1.6.6 or later from
  https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

If this is your first time using Rust, these [Installation
Notes](README-installation-notes.md) might be helpful.

### Configure CLI 

1. Set CLI config url to localhost cluster

```bash
$ solana config set --url localhost
```

2. Create CLI Keypair

If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:

```bash
$ solana-keygen new
```

### Start local Solana cluster

This example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

Start a local Solana cluster:
```bash
$ solana-test-validator
```
**WARNING: `solana-test-validator` is not currently available for native Windows.  Try using WSL, or switch to Linux or macOS**

Listen to transaction logs:
```bash
$ solana logs
```

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Build the on-chain program

There is both a Rust and C version of the on-chain program, whichever is built
last will be the one used when running the example.

```bash
$ npm run build:program-rust
```

```bash
$ npm run build:program-c
```

### Deploy the on-chain program

```bash
$ solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so
```

### Run the JavaScript client

```bash
$ npm run start
```

### Expected output

Public key values will differ:

```bash
Let's say hello to a Solana account...
Connection to cluster established: http://localhost:8899 { 'feature-set': 3714435735, 'solana-core': '1.6.6' }
Using account AiT1QgeYaK86Lf9kudqKthQPCWwpG8vFA1bAAioBoF4X containing 0.00141872 SOL to pay for fees
Using program Dro9uk45fxMcKWGb1eWALujbTssh6DW8mb4x8x3Eq5h6

8MBmHtJvxpKdYhdw6yPpedp6X6y2U9dCpdYaZJdmwV3A has been greeted 1 times
Success
```

#### Not seeing the expected output?

- Ensure you've [started the local cluster](#start-local-solana-cluster),
  [built the on-chain program](#build-the-on-chain-program) and [deployed the program to the cluster](#deploy-the-on-chain-program).
- Inspect the program logs by running `solana logs` to see why the program failed.
  - ```bash
    Transaction executed in slot 5621:

    Status: Error processing Instruction 0: Program failed to complete
    Log Messages:

      Program G5bbS1ipWzqQhekkiCLn6u7Y1jJdnGK85ceSYLx2kKbA failed: Program failed to complete

### Customizing the Program

To customize the example, make changes to the files under `/src`.  If you change
any files under `/src/program-rust` or `/src/program-c` you will need to
[rebuild the on-chain program](#build-the-on-chain-program) and [redeploy the program](#deploy-the-on-chain-program).

Now when you rerun `npm run start`, you should see the results of your changes.

## Learn about Solana

More information about how Solana works is available in the [Solana
documentation](https://docs.solana.com/) and all the source code is available on
[github](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana)

## Learn about the client

The client in this example is written in TypeScript using:
- [Solana web3.js SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
- [Solana web3 API](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js)

### Entrypoint

The [client's
entrypoint](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/main.ts#L13)
does five things.

### Establish a connection to the cluster

The client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling
[`establishConnection`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L92).

### Establish an account to pay for transactions

The client ensures there is an account available to pay for transactions,
and creates one if there is not, by calling
[`establishPayer`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L102).

### Check if the helloworld on-chain program has been deployed

In [`checkProgram`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L144),
the client loads the keypair of the deployed program from `./dist/program/helloworld-keypair.json` and uses
the public key for the keypair to fetch the program account. If the program doesn't exist, the client halts
with an error. If the program does exist, it will create a new account with the program assigned as its owner
to store program state (number of hello's processed).

### Send a "Hello" transaction to the on-chain program

The client then constructs and sends a "Hello" transaction to the program by
calling
[`sayHello`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L209).
The transaction contains a single very simple instruction that primarily carries
the public key of the helloworld program account to call and the "greeter"
account to which the client wishes to say "Hello" to.

### Query the Solana account used in the "Hello" transaction

Each time the client says "Hello" to an account, the program increments a
numerical count in the "greeter" account's data.  The client queries the
"greeter" account's data to discover the current number of times the account has
been greeted by calling
[`reportGreetings`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L226).

## Learn about the on-chain program

The [on-chain helloworld program](/src/program-rust/Cargo.toml) is a Rust program
compiled to [Berkley Packet Format
(BPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) and stored as an
[Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) shared
object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

The program is written using:
- [Solana Rust SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/sdk)

### Programming on Solana

To learn more about Solana programming model refer to the [Programming Model
Overview](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview).

To learn more about developing programs on Solana refer to the [On-Chain 
Programs Overview](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/overview)

## Pointing to a public Solana cluster

Solana maintains three public clusters:
- `devnet` - Development cluster with airdrops enabled
- `testnet` - Tour De Sol test cluster without airdrops enabled
- `mainnet-beta` -  Main cluster

Use the Solana CLI to configure which cluster to connect to.

To point to `devnet`:
```bash
$ solana config set --url devnet
```

To point back to the local cluster:
```bash
$ solana config set --url localhost
```

## Expand your skills with advanced examples

There is lots more to learn; The following examples demonstrate more advanced
features like custom errors, advanced account handling, suggestions for data
serialization, benchmarking, etc...
